# Advent of Code 2018
My personal solutions to the Advent of Code 2018 programming challenges. So far, I've used Python 3.7.1 with the modules included in the standard library.

Update 2018-12-03:
I've also started practicing with some of the puzzles from the previous editions. I'll add solutions to that to the "previous_editions" folder.
