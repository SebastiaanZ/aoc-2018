# Advent of Code 2018
My personal solutions to the Advent of Code 2018 programming challenges. All puzzles were solved using Python 3.7.1 64-bit on Ubuntu 18.10.


#### Modules used for 2018 puzzles:
##### Standard Library
- itertools
- collections
- string
- datetime
- multiprocessing

##### From SciPy
- numpy


### Previous editions
I've also started practicing with some of the puzzles from the previous editions. I'll add solutions to that to the ["previous_editions" folder](../../tree/master/previous_editions/).
